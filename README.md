## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [Fonts Google](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font family

### What I learned

Firstly I had to learn some basics of flexbox which I used to center the whole element and also by changing its css property flex-direction to column I made mobile version of the card component. Given the advice which I received in the last Frontend Mentor challenge I tried to use more semantic HTML code. I used elements like article, section and button. The last thing I had to learn were media queries to define when the mobile version will be applied.
